%An introduction where you explain the aims and rationale for the physics case and what you have done. At the end of the introduction you should give a brief summary of the structure of the report

%When you write the introduction you could focus on the following aspects: -Motivate the reader, the first part of the introduction gives always a motivation and tries to give the overarching ideas. -What I have done. -The structure of the report, how it is organized etc
\noindent

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Motivation, radionuclide therapy
    \item History (LBNL)
    \item Where we are today 
    \item What I have done; Stacked target irradiation to find experimental cross sections
    \item Structure of the report
\end{enumerate}

Targeted radionuclide therapy is an emerging alternative to external beam therapy
%, as it allows for a accustumed dose deposition in the healthy tissue
