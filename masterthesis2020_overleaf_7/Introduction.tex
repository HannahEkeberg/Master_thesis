Nuclear medicine is today an accepted field in medicine, where radionuclides are important in both therapautic and diagnostic purposes \footnote{https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1524/ract.1995.7071.special-issue.249}, and has especially  been of importance to cancer. \\ 

Before a radionuclide can be used clinically, a well established excitation function must be known, to maximise the production and minimizing impurities. There already exists large amounts of information on neutron induced reactions. However the information on charged-particle induced reactions is not as strong, so we need more data on this behalf \foonote{(Syed M. Qaim. Nuclear data for production and medical application of radionuclides: Present status and future needs. Nuclear Medicine and Biology, 44:31â€“49, jan 2017.).} Along with neutron dryness, the search for alternative production methods using accelerators or charged particle beams are good! 
This work is a small contribution to nuclear reaction data for potentially usefull platinum and iridium radionuclides, and a contribution to nuclear reaction data in general. 

Platinum and iridium radionuclides ! 

Nuclear cross section are usefull in many applications, such as ....,
