\chapter{Summary and outlook}
The main interest in this work was to find the energy window which minimizes the production of stable $^{192, 194}$Pt which lack the destructive effect of $^{193m}$Pt and avoid the production of particularly $^{191}$Pt which will contribute to an undesired dose. From the ........ .......  it appears as this is the best window, and perhaps to avoid 191 production use a enriched target of 193Ir. In comparison to other methods of production, the activity which was in the max cs window was about, other work has been ... 

In addition to platinum radionuclides, 192Ir is also of interest blablabla.... 



In addition, this experiment has provided multiple reaction data, which are useful for other novel medical radionuclides such as  ....
Summary, conclusion? 

\section{Outlook}
The research of the production of $^{193m}$Pt is in the early stages for clinical applications. This work has been a contribution to measure the energy-window which gives the highest purity without other Platinum contaminants. Further research will focus on thick target irradiation to produce quantities for research on the chemical separation and labelling chemical labelling to Cis-platin, which is planned to run ...... In addition, an analysis on the Auger spectrum is planned to run ..... Finally, integrating this isomer into the DNA is vital, along with targeting the cancerous cells. In addition, a imaging agent with similar properties and sufficiently long half-life should be checked out to see if it is possible to use later!
