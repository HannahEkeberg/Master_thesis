-The 191 Pt and 193mPt cross sections are equal, how to separate? use enriched targets? 

-Include the peak equation for fitzpeaks. In addition, parabolic background? 

-Collect the correct monitor experimental data per reaction. 

-Add in cross sections, finish discussion. 

- Fluence loss based on monitor reactions?? 

- make nuclear chart plot of possible ways to produce 193mPt.
