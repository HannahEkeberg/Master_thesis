abstract = {Theoretical models often differ significantly from measured data in their predictions of the magnitude of nuclear reactions that produce radionuclides for medical, research, and national security applications. In this paper, we compare a priori predictions from several state-of-the-art reaction modeling packages (CoH, EMPIRE, TALYS, and ALICE) to cross sections measured using the stacked-target activation method. The experiment was performed using the LBNL 88-Inch Cyclotron with beams of 25 and 55 MeV protons on a stack of iron, copper, and titanium foils. 34 excitation functions were measured for 4 {\textless} Ep {\textless} 55 MeV, including the first measurement of the independent cross sections for natFe(p,x) 49,51Cr, 51,52m,52g,56Mn, and 58m,58gCo. All of the models failed to reproduce the isomer-to-ground state ratio for reaction channels at compound and pre-compound energies, suggesting issues in modeling the deposition or distribution of angular momentum in these residual nuclei.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the role of peptides in cancer therapy with special emphasis on peptide drugs which are already approved and those in clinical trials. The potential of peptides in cancer treatment is evident from a variety of different strategies that are available to address the progression of tumor growth and propagation of the disease. Use of peptides that can directly target cancer cells without affecting normal cells (targeted therapy) is evolving as an alternate strategy to conventional chemotherapy. Peptide can be utilized directly as a cytotoxic agent through various mechanisms or can act as a carrier of cytotoxic agents and radioisotopes by specifically targeting cancer cells. Peptide-based hormonal therapy has been extensively studied and utilized for the treatment of breast and prostate cancers. Tremendous amount of clinical data is currently available attesting to the efficiency of peptide-based cancer vaccines. Combination therapy is emerging as an important strategy to achieve synergistic effects in fighting cancer as a single method alone may not be efficient enough to yield positive results. Combining immunotherapy with conventional therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy or combining an anticancer peptide with a nonpeptidic cytotoxic drug is an example of this emerging field.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses neutron capture and nuclear constitution. A typical result of the experiments with high-speed neutrons is the great probability that a collision with a nucleus of not too large an atomic number will give rise to the ejection of an $\alpha$-ray or a proton, accompanied by the capture of the neutron and the formation of a nucleus of a new element which in general will possess $\beta$-ray radioactivity. The effective nuclear cross-sections for collisions with such effects are, in fact, of the same order of magnitude as the cross-sections responsible for simple scattering of high-sped neutrons by nuclei that, in turn, agree with ordinary estimates of nuclear dimensions. The phenomena of neutron capture forces to assume that a collision between a high-speed neutron and a heavy nucleus will in the first place result in the formation of a compound system of remarkable stability. The possible later breaking up of this intermediate system by the ejection of a material particle, or its passing with emission of radiation to a final stable state, must be considered as separate competing processes that have no immediate connexion with the first stage of the encounter. {\textcopyright} 1986, Elsevier Science {\&} Technology.

Steady progress shows that fusion — an important additional option for energy production in the future — promises to be a clean and safe solution for mankind's long-term energy needs with minimal environmental impact. A source of energy which would be inexhaustible, inherently safe and environmentally friendly, is this not a marvellous prospect? Nuclear fusion, a possible candidate for this role, has been the energy source of our Sun and the stars in the universe for billions of years. This process requires temperatures of tens of millions of degrees, so extremely high and foreign to our daily experience that it seems out of reach. Nevertheless, these extremely high temperatures are routinely realised in several laboratories all over the world, and since the early 1990s, tens of MW fusion power have been released from fusion reactions. We are witnessing the birth of a new technology destined to meet the gigantic future energy needs of mankind with minimal impact on the environment.},

abstract = {A stacked-target of natural lanthanum foils (99.9119{\%} 139La) was irradiated using a 60 MeV proton beam at the LBNL 88-Inch Cyclotron. 139La(p,x) cross sections are reported between 35–60 MeV for nine product radionuclides. The primary motivation for this measurement was the need to quantify the production of 134Ce. As a positron-emitting analogue of the promising medical radionuclide 225Ac, 134Ce is desirable for in vivo applications of bio-distribution assays for this emerging radio-pharmaceutical. The results of this measurement were compared to the nuclear model codes TALYS, EMPIRE and ALICE (using default parameters), which showed significant deviation from the measured values.},

Experimental capabilities for the generation of neutron beams from deuteron breakups and radiation testing of carbon nanotube field effect transistor will be discussed.},

abstract = {For the production of therapy-relevant radionuclides 193mPt (T1/2=4.33 d) and 195mPt (T1/2=4.03 d) with a high specific activity, the 192Os($\alpha$,n)195mPt and 192Os($\alpha$,3n)193mPt nuclear reactions were investigated for the first time from their respective thresholds up to 28 MeV. Thin samples of enriched 192Os were prepared by electrodeposition on Ni, and the conventional stacked-foil technique was used for cross-section measurements. The calculated thick target yields were found to be 0.013 MBq/$\mu$A h for the 192Os($\alpha$,n)195mPt reaction in the energy range of E$\alpha$=24→18 MeV, and 0.25 MBq/$\mu$A h for the 192Os($\alpha$,3n)193mPt reaction in the energy range of E$\alpha$=28→24 MeV. The two radionuclides could not be detected in the interactions of 3He particles with 192Os. A production method involving high-current $\alpha$-particle irradiation of enriched 192Os and efficient chemical separation of radioplatinum was developed. Batch yields of about 1 MBq 195mPt and 8.7 MBq 193mPt were achieved. Compared to the reactor production these batch yields are very low, but the 192Os($\alpha$,n)195mPt and 192Os($\alpha$,3n)193mPt reactions are superior with respect to the specific activity of the products which is higher by two orders of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background . Paranasal and nasal cavity malignancies are rare tumors that frequently present at advanced stages. Tumor extension and anatomic complexity pose a challenge for their treatment. Due to their peculiar physical and biological properties particle radiation therapy, i.e. protons and ions can have a role in their management. We performed a systematic literature review to gather clinical evidence about their use to treat sinonasal malignancies. Materials and Methods . We searched the browsers PubMed and Medline as well as specific journals and conference proceedings. Inclusion criteria were: at least 10 patients, English language, reporting outcome and/or toxicity data. Results . We found six studies with data on clinical outcome. Carbon and helium ions were each used in one study, protons in four. Toxicity was specifically described in five studies. One reported acute toxicity of carbon ions, one dealt with brain toxicity from both carbon ions and protons. Three papers reported on visual toxicity: one from carbon ions, one from protons and one from both. Specific data were extracted and compared with the most pertinent literature. Conclusion . Particle radiation therapy is in its early phase of development. Promising results achieved so far must be confirmed in further studies.},

abstract = {After a long gestation period, heavy-ion physics and chemistry is now, worldwide, the most rapidly growing area of nuclear science, and the concepts, techniques, and instrumentation of this heavy-ion work are finding ever-widening application in other areas of science and technology. Although there remain broad regions at higher energies, with heavier projectiles, and at higher excitations and angular momenta where heavy ions still provide gateways into the totally unknown, intensive studies over the past two decades have provided a sound framework of understanding of many of the salient features of interactions induced by these new heavier projectiles and a basis for coherent planning of future studies.},
