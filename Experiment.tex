Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) is a national research laboratory on behalf of the Us. Department of Energy, and is operated by University of California, Berkeley. The laboratory starter up in 1928 by founder Ernest O. Lawrence, who is also the inventor of the cyclotron. \textcolor{red}{What other fields are researched upon in LBNL.} \textit{from wiki: Several great discoveries were done at LBNL, among some, oberservation of the antiproton, discovery of accelerating universe and transuranic elements. }

\noindent
The Lawrence Berkeley's 88" Cyclotron has many purposes, eg. isotope production for medical applications and heavy element search, and commercial use.  \textcolor{red}{Correct?} \\

\noindent
The  facility is figured in \ref{fig:LBNL_88}, and consist of a cyclotron vault, and experimental caves in which the beam can be bent to with bending magnets. Faraday cups can measure the beam current at different steps along the way, which makes it possible to measure the transition efficiency of the beam. Faraday cups are dense metal block, usually 6-7 cm broad Cupper and tantilum. It works as a beam stopper, and can be lowered into the beam line to measure the current. It is electrically isolated, which makes it possible to measure the current, since we know the number of initial particles accelerated. Due to electrons close to surface might be scattered of, can read of higher positive charge than what is correct. Put magnet around the cup to bend the electrons back to the Faraday cup in what is called magnetic suppression.
\noindent
Cave 0 is used mainly for neutron beam, chemistry, and isotope production, and was used for irradiation of the target stack.

\subsection{General functionality of a Cyclotron}
Cyclotrons consist of two D-shaped electrodes shaped as a circle with a gap between, and an electromagnet consisting of two coils in which the electrode is placed between. This creates a magnetic field perpendicular to the electrodes. 
From the Lorentz Force, with a magnetic field perpendicular to an electric field will give a circular movement of a particle of charge $q$,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lorentz}
    \textbf{F} = q\textbf{E} + q\textbf{v} \times \textbf{B}
\end{equation}

An oscillating electric field is applied between the electrodes, which makes the particles accelerate over the gap between the electrode, be bent in a circular motion and accelerated back with the shifting electrical field. The frequency of the field is called the radio-frequency (RF), or the cyclotron resonance
\begin{equation}
    f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
\end{equation}
Particles which are not synchronized with the RF-field is lost \cite{KireeffCovo2018}. \textcolor{red}{Include figure of cyclotron?}  

We can rewrite equation \label{eq:Lorentz}, using the centripetal force, $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$. Since the centripetal force works in the same direction as the magnetic field, we can set $F_c=qvB$, which gives the radius of the particle path 
\begin{equation}
    r = \frac{mv}{qB}
\end{equation}
With increasing velocity, the radius of the path increases. But to obtain the RF, the velocity of the particle must also increase, hence the acceleration over the gap. This way, particles moves in an outward spiral, until they have gained sufficient energy wanted. The cyclotron must be operated in a vacuum, so the beam is not attenuated due to air particles.

\section{The experiment}



The experimental cross section for a nucleus is described in the following equation

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CrossSection_general}
    \sigma(\langle E \rangle) = \frac{A_0}{\rho\Delta r I (1-e^{-\lambda \Delta t})}
\end{equation}



where $\langle E \rangle$ is the average energy across the foil, $A_0$ (Bq) is the activity after end of beam, $\rho \Delta r$ is the areal density of the target (nuclei/cm$^2$), I is the beam current (A), $\lambda$ is the decay constant ($s^{-1}$) of the nucleus and $\Delta t$ (s) is the length of the irradiation. %$A_0$ is found through by backpropagation of activities measured at multiple timepoints after end of beam, and will be further described in section \textcolor{red}{end of beam activity section}. The mass density of an

\subsection{Target design}
\textit{\textcolor{red}{Also, write about thin targets, underfilled beam, advantageous.}}\\

\noindent 
In this experiment, a stack of ten thin $^{\text{nat}}$Ir (99.9\%), ten $^{\text{nat}}$Ni, ten $^{\text{nat}}$Cu and three $^{\text{nat}}$Fe foils were irradiated with 33 MeV deuterions to induce nuclear reactions  \textcolor{red}{(provide info about foils, like where they were bought, and abundance and purity of the metal)}. The design of the target stack is well described in the literature (Voyles2018). Using a stacked target in a cross section experiment provides cross sections at multiple energies due to the energy degradation of the beam in the stack. With each foil being approximately 25 $\mu$m in thickness, cross sections were measured within high precision on the energy. Deuterions on Nickel, Cupper and Iron have several well known cross sections, which was used to determine the beam current throughout the stack, by solving equation \ref{eq:CrossSection_general} for beam current, and using these cross sections. These reactions are called monitor reactions, and we were particularly interested in $^{\text{nat}}$Ni(d,x)$^{56,58}$Co, $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(d,x)$^{62, 63, 75}$Zn and $^{\text{nat}}$Fe(d,x)$^{56}$Co.  \\ 

%The targets are larger than the beam, hence underfilled. Then the correct nuc/cmË†2 
\noindent
In this experiment, the beam was underfilled, meaning that the area of the target was larger than the beamspot. Hence the areal density was then used to calculate the quantity of how many nuclei per cm$^2$. Areal density is given as 
\begin{equation}
    \rho \Delta r = \frac{m}{A}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where m is the mass and A is the area. The uncertainty in each parameter was calculated using the standard deviation 
\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where N is the number of measurements, $x_i$ is a measurement and $\overline{x}$ is the average over all measurements. 

\noindent
Since each of these parameters are independent, the uncertainty can be calculated using the approximation for uncertainty 

\begin{equation}
    \Big(\frac{\delta \rho \Delta r}{\rho \Delta r}\Big)^2= \Big(\frac{\delta m}{m}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{\delta A}{A}\Big)^2
\end{equation}

\noindent 
The foils were cut into approximately 25 by 25 mm squares. Each foil was characterized using a caliper\footnote{MITUTOYO, ABSOLUTE DIGIMATIC} to measure the length of each side, a gauge caliper\footnote{MITUTOYO, IP65 COOLANT PROOF} to measure the thickness, and a weight\footnote{METTLER TOLEDO} was used to weight each foil which were pre-washed with isopropanol. For each foil, the length (across all sides) and thickness was measured at four different locations along the foils (they were not completely uniform). The foils were weighted four times as well. The thickness was not used in the calculation of the mass density, but was a good indication that the foil thicknesses were consistent. Conversion of the areal density to nuclei/$cm^2$ was done numerically, by multiplying by Avogadro's number and dividing by the mol-mass of the target.

\noindent
Table \ref{table:foil_characterization} shows the target stack with average values for length, thickness and areal density, and calculated areal density (in the order they were irradiated). After characterization, each foil was mounted on a plastic frame, and attached with capton tape along the edges. The target frames can be seen in figure \ref{fig:targetframe}.

\subsection{Detector calibration}
In this experiment, seven different high purity Germanium detectors (HPGe) were used to measure the activity in each foil at multiple timepoints after end of beam. The HPGe-detector is a type of semiconductor, which is a material where the energy required to remove an electron from the valence band (in the outer atomic shell) to the conduction band is small. A Germanium atom has atomic number 32, and 4 valence electrons in the outer p4 shell. The atoms are bound through covalent bonds in a crystal structure. The main mechanism of a semiconductor detector is creation of electron-hole pairs after energy deposition of an ionizing particle in the crystal. If an electron is excited to the conduction band, a hole is left. The hole can move as a neighbooring electron fills this spot, and it can cause a chain reaction, and the hole will move in the crystal. Both the electron in the conduction band and the hole in  the valence band contributes to an electric current. Under influence of an electric field, the electron-hole pairs will be collected, and we can measure the incidence as a count. The major advantage with semiconductor detector is that the average energy to create an electron-hole pair is very low, which results in a superior energy resolution in comparison to other detectors like gas and scintillation detectors. \textcolor{red}{High energy resolution advantageous in gamma-ray spectroscopy which makes it possible to separate to gamma-ray peaks within less than a keV.} At room temperature,  thermal energy can excite the electron from the valence to the conduction band and cause noise in spectra. Therefor, Germanium detectors are operated at 0 Kelvin. \textcolor{red}{Write about recombination and trapping, noise, np semiconductor junction, depletion depth??}.

\textcolor{red}{
The detectors along with crystal geometry and dimension is listed in table \ref{tab:detector_characteristics}. Detector 1-6 was counted in cave 4c, which is an old beam chamber. Hence, background radiation from ........ are present in the room. Detector 7 was counted in a room with little backgrond, and also led shielding surronding the detector. }


\subsubsection{Detector efficiency}
The detector efficiency is the number of events registered divided by the events emitted by the source. The absolute efficiency can be divided into intrinsic and geometrical efficiency, where the intrinsic efficiency is the number of evens registered divided by the number of evens hitting the detector. The intrinsic efficiency thus depends on the interaction cross section between incident particle and detector material. For neutral particles, the size of the detector affects the intrinsic efficiency, the larger crystal the larger the probability of interaction is. The geometrical efficiency is the radiation emitted by the source which hits the detector. (Techniques for Nuclear and Particle Physics Experiments. William R. Leo. Second Revised Edition. Springer.Verlag Berkling Heidelberg GmbH, New York (1994). p. 121-122 )\\ 




\noindent 
In calculation of the efficiency of each detector, calibration point sources $^{137}$Cs ($t_{1/2}$=30.08 years), $^{133}$Ba ($t_{1/2}$=10.551 years) and $^{152}$Eu ($t_{1/2}$=13.517 years) was used. Figure \ref{fig:cal_sources} shows the sources along with activity at reference date which was January 1$^{\text{st}}$, 2009. \textcolor{red}{ $^{22}$Na was initially planned to be used, however was excluded due to difficulties with the gamma line}. Table \ref{table:calibration_gammas} shows an overview of the different gamma lines that was used in order to calculate the efficiency. The calibration sources were counted on all the different detectors at specific distances from the detector. Maestro\footnote{https://www.ortec-online.com/products/application-software/maestro-mca} (Multichannel Analyzer Emulation Software) was used in spectroscopy.  \\

\noindent 
\textcolor{red}{
A detector has a dead layer, and the radiation needs sufficient energy to penetrate through this window. }

    \label{fig:cal_sources}
\end{figure}

\noindent 
The activity of the calibration sources at the time between the reference date and the date measurement (referred to as delay time) is 
\begin{equation}
    A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda \Delta t_\text{delay}}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $A_0$ is the activity on the reference date and $\lambda$ is the decay constant. The total number of decayed nuclei since the reference date and during the count is 
\begin{equation}
\Delta D = -\int_{\Delta t_\text{delay}}^{\Delta t_\text{delay}+\Delta t_\text{livetime}} A(t)dt
\end{equation}
\noindent 
Solving the integral, the number of decayed nuclei since the reference date is 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta D = \frac{A_0}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda \Delta t_\text{delay}}(1-e^{-\lambda \Delta t_\text{live}})
\end{equation}

\noindent
where the live is the livetime of the spectrum is the time it was counting events \textcolor{red}{(the real time which has accounted for the deadtime, the time where the system is enable to register events after an event)}. 
The net area of the peak is described as 
\begin{equation}
    N_C = \Delta D I_\gamma \epsilon(E_\gamma)
\end{equation} 

\noindent 
which gives us an efficiency as a function of $E_\gamma$

\begin{equation} \label{eq:efficiency}
    \epsilon(E_\gamma)=\frac{\lambda N_C}{A_0 I_\gamma(1-e^{-\lambda \Delta t_\text{live}})e^{-\lambda \Delta t_\text{delay}}}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Equation \ref{eq:efficiency} gives the efficiency value at one specific $E_\gamma$. In order to find a general efficiency curve for the detector, a model based upon  Gallagher, W.J., & Cipolla, S.J. (1974) was applied, which takes the probability of penetration through the deadlayer of the detector and the probability of interaction in detector volume into account: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:efficiency_estimated}
\epsilon(E_\gamma) =  B_0 + \underbrace{(e^{-B_1 E_\gamma^{B_2}})}_\text{dead layer}  \underbrace{(1-e^{-B_3 E_\gamma^{B_4}}))}_\text{interacting with volume} 
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $B_4$ are guessing parameters which were found through the scipy curve fit function\footnote{\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html}}. An example of an efficiency curve can be seen in figure \ref{fig:efficiency_curve}.  %Figure \ref{fig:ex_eff_curve} shows an example for such a fitted efficiency curve. When guessing parameters are found, we have efficiency for the detector at any gamma energy.

\subsection{Irradiaton of target stack}
The irradiation of the target stack included a tuning of the beam and one hour of irradiation. Before we could turn on beam, we had to pump down the tube to a vacuum, to not attenuate the beam. \textcolor{red}{check the vacuum in notes}


\subsection{Tuning of the beam}
Before irradiation, the beam was tuned to have the \textcolor{red}{correct energy and beam spot}. The first step was to visualize the beam spot. \textcolor{red}{A glass plate with a 1 cm cross in the center that was painted with phosphorus was placed in the end of the beam tube}. With a camera placed in Cave 0 (not in the beamline), we could visualize the beamspot in the control room. This way, it was possible to steer the beam to be perfectly centered, which was important for the following experiment which used small targets. The next step was to visualize the beam over the target stack, \textcolor{red}{to make sure that the beam did not converge/diverge, spread?}. Gafchromic film changes color when exposed to ionizing radiation. A film was placed in the front and in the back of the target holder, and exposed for a brief seconds. This was done a couple of times before we were satisfied with the beamspot. \\

\noindent 
The last part of the beam tuning was to find beam efficiency of transmission which was done measuring the current at the Faraday cup right after the cyclotron vaul (BS-2) and right before cave 0 (FC-01). BS-2 was measured to be 420 nA, and FC-01 was measured to be 285 nA. This gave a beam efficiency of transmission
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{FC-01}{BS-02}=67\%
\end{equation*}

Faraday cup right after Cyclotron vault $$BS-2 = 420 nA$$, and right before cave 0 was $$FC-01=285 nA$$

That gives a beam efficiency of transmission 

$$\frac{FC-01}{BS-02}=67.9\%$$

\subsection{The irradiation of the target stack}

Figure \ref{fig:stack} shows the targets stacked in the beam holder, and figure \ref{fig:tube} shows how it was placed in the beam tube.

The target was irradiated for exactly an hour, and the current read of the beam integrator evenly, so assure it increases constantly. Beam current from beam integrator was 128.5 nA. Full scale amperes was $2\cdot 10^{-7} $ A. Right after end of beam, the targets were sealed in small plastic bags to avoid contamination, and counted immediately.

\subsection{Beam profile}
The stainless steel in the front and back of the target stack was attached to a gafchromic film after irradiation, and we were able to measure the actual beamprofile throgh the target stack. Due to scattering, the beam profile tends to broaden through the stack. However, the beam was stopped in the stack, hence the profile that was measured is not valid for the spread in the stack. \textcolor{red}{Image-J\footnote{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html} is an imaging process program that allowed us to measure the beam spot, finding the relative intensity of the beam spot on the gafchromic films. Radius of the activity from stainless on gafchromic film is used in program Image-J. The intesity profile is Gaussian, and the beamprofile had a full width half maximum of ...., and in the back was .... }. By measuring the beam profile, we were able to build confidence in the size of the beam spot. The stainless steel \textcolor{red}{(which consist of )} has fast decay time. It emits beta particles. Since beta particles do not emit straight, thus the actual beam spot is slightly smaller.   

\subsubsection{Counting on detectors}
Since counts are based upon Poisson statistics, \textcolor{red}{check notes!!!}, the more counts each peak has, the better statistics. Right after end of beam all the foils were counted for a short period of time to assure to measure the short-lived activities. Since the decay-rate for these nuclei are high, the statistics were ok. The longer after end of beam, the longer counts to assure good statistics for the longer-lived products. The foils were counted for a period of 4 weeks after end of beam. Backgrond spectra were taken for each detector as well. This was especially important for detectors 1-6 which were located in cave 4C, where background was present.
